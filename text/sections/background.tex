\section{Background}

Prime editing is a versatile and precise genome editing technology that enables the introduction of all 12 possible base-to-base conversions as well as insertions and deletions without the need for double-strand breaks\cite{liudavidr.SearchandreplaceGenomeEditing2019}. 

The versatility of prime editors comes from the fusion of a reverse transcriptase (RT) and a Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) (Add figure here on prime editing process)
